# WebToDoList  
A quick To-Do List web application implemented using jQuery, plain JS, css, and HTML5. Inspired by the Colt Steele Web Developer Bootcamp.  
  
Future work:  
* Add cleaner styling  
* Replace jQuery Library references with a more modern web framework (Angular)  
* Set up database connection so to do list is based off of consistent data, instead of hard-coded initial data
